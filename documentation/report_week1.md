# Project speficiation

The project idea is to create a program to recognize hand written numbers with a neural network that has been created from scratch. Hence, the network should perform a classification task. The exact implemementation of the network will become more accurate later but the network will consist of at least the following:

- A class for the entire network
- One class for the base layer of the network
    - Methods: back propagation and forward propagation, activation
- Classes for different types of layers (input layer, hidden layers, output layer)
- Cost functions

## Algorithm and Data Structure design

There will be multiple algorithms needed in this project, mainly related to training the layers (forward propagation and back propagation). 

The data structure of the neural network will be a matrix that will be created as a numpy array. 

#### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the project depends on the time complexity of different matrix operations. Most of these can be performed in linear time.

#### Space Complexity
